* Worked with __forecasting__ the future demand for __NVIDIA__ products based on a set of constraints. 
* Implemented various __state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models__ to make predictions about the future based on past supplies and various predictors. 
* Added __explainability__ to the models with the use of tools such as __LIME__ and __SHAP__ for all the forecast models. 
* Enhanced the working of __SAP__ forecast models by adding custom models that improved the overall efficiency and accuracy as a result of a combination of models.
