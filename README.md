1. Worked with forecasting the future based on supply and demand constraints. 
2. Implemented various state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models to make predictions about the future based on the past supplies and various predictors. 
3. Added explainability to the models with the use of tools such as LIME and SHAP for all the forecast models.
