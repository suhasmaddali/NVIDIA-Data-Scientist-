# NVIDIA Data Scientist Intern

1. Worked with __forecasting__ the future based on supply and demand constraints. 
2. Implemented various __state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models__ to make predictions about the future based on the past supplies and various predictors. 
3. Added __explainability__ to the models with the use of tools such as __LIME__ and __SHAP__ for all the forecast models. 
4. Enhanced the working of SAP forecast models by adding custom models that improved the overall efficiency and accuracy of the final set of models that was a combination of a list of models.
